Sprinkled from Ted lasso
unflappable affability, optimism bordering on naivety, earnestness, inclusivity

1) Team over individual. Rock star assholes will ruin the culture and lose the game because they won't pass.
2) Extreme delegation. The best ideas can come from anyone, even the kit man. Step aside and give them room to work their magic.
3) Vulnerability builds trust.
4) Care more about people than their output. It makes work more fun and creates lasting results.
5) Root out and remove destructive cultural beliefs. Like if the team thinks there's a curse in the room.
6) Fix low-hanging fruit. Improve the water pressure if the team complains about it.
7) Have a support group. Bring your problems to them. (Bonus: name it "Diamond Dogs.")
8) Believe. Because if you don't, no one else on your team will.
